SqlRunner doesn't like it when you try to jam a second statement into it because it'll only run one at a time.

Refactoring: most of the actions could be administrated from the main 'all transaction' view. e.g a '+' button next to tag, merchant, spending columns to direct to adding new tags, merchants and transactions. There could also be an option in thew drop-downs to create a new tag that takes you to the right page. Transaction ID should only be displayed on the specific transaction's page, if it is even needed as the timestamp is probably more useful to the user. Transactions should have an edit button on the main view next to the delete button.

Tags and merchants should ask for confirmation before editing and deleting as they affect all linked transactions.

Wondering if I'm being too strict about my data as everything is an inner join, though banks would probably be this strict anyway.
